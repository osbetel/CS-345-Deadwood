Assignment 2, Part 1:
Project skeleton files.

Compiling instructions:
1) first, open up a terminal and cd to the src directory.
2) then, in the src directory, execute the following:
"javac -d <output directory> *.java"

3) You can specify an output directory using the -d flag.
I like to use 

"javac -d ~/Desktop/out *.java"

which will output all the compiled classes to the desktop.

If you simply use

"javac *.java" then it will output all compiled class files into the same directory as the java files.
